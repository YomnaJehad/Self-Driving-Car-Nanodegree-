# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road:
    - Applying on what I learned from the lesson, the arrangement of the functions, and the parameters' tunning.
    - Edit the output of the hough lines to form TWO Red Lines roughly representing the Two lane lines.
    - Test On 6 images.
    - Test on 2 videos.
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
